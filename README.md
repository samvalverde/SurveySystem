# SurveySystem

  The goal of the project is to design and implement a back-end survey system using Docker, Docker Compose, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis and RestAPI. This system will allow users to create, publish
and manage surveys with different types of questions, as well as register and manage lists of respondents.
